# Underscores can be used in integers as we use commas in larger numbers for easier readability.
# Ex. 1_22_342    this will be interpreted as 122342, and python will just remove the underscores.

# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number.
# e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8.
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print(type(two_digit_number))
first_digit = two_digit_number[0]
second_digit = two_digit_number[1]

#Mathematical 
# order is PEMDAS [paranthesis, exponent, multiply/division, additin/substract] from left to right.

#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = int(weight) / (float(height) ** 2)
print(int(bmi))
#When we use type conversin on float number to int, it will just get rid of all decimal places.
#Alternatively, we can round them off like this ðŸ‘‡
print(round(bmi))
#And if we want to print few decimal places, then simply make these changes:
print(round(bmi, 2))
#There is another way to get the whole number with flow division which requires no type conversion.
print(8 // 3) # this can be verified by using type() method. print(type(8 // 3))
#Shorthand --> number += 2, etc.
