# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

## Day 0: October 7th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Started off the course with variables, string manipulation and debugging errors.

### Thoughts: 
This was very easy as i have tried this already, but since I want to commit to this course and code for 100 days to form a habbit, will not skip and commit to this.

### Today's Progress: Data types, Type Error/Checking/Conversion and F strings

### Thoughts:
I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
