## Day 4: October 10th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Randomization, Lists

### Thoughts:
I was able to get a good understanding of randomization use through random module and Lists. Basic use cases of lists, accessing the elements from nested lists was relatively easy. Treasure map exercise (code is insided day-4-learnings.py in code-snippets repo) was good to play around with. 
Rock Paper Scissors game exercise was a little difficult to code. Simple logic was straight-forward but more sophisticated code with all possible scenarios inluding larger number than intended took much time.
