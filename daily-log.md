# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

## Day 1: October 7th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Started off the course with variables, string manipulation and debugging errors.

### Thoughts: 
This was very easy as i have tried this already, but since I want to commit to this course and code for 100 days to form a habbit, will not skip and commit to this.

## Day 2: October 8th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Data types, Arithmetic operators, Type Error/Checking/Conversion and F string

### Thoughts:
It was easy but interesting with short coding exercises. Have good understanding of type conversion, arithmetic operators and their order now.
f-String is a very handy way to print different data types without the need to convert them first.

## Day 3: October 9th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Conditional statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope

### Thoughts:
Lot of good exercises helped understanding conditional statements and different implementations of them. I struggled with leap year program because of logic interpretation, and this is when i found out that drawing flowchart diagrams in situations like this where you are stuck really really helps a lot.

## Day 4: October 10th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Randomization, Lists

### Thoughts:
I was able to get a good understanding of randomization use through random module and Lists. Basic use cases of lists, accessing the elements from nested lists was relatively easy. Treasure map exercise (code is insided day-4-learnings.py in code-snippets repo) was good to play around with. 
Rock Paper Scissors game exercise was a little difficult to code. Simple logic was straight-forward but more sophisticated code with all possible scenarios inluding larger number than intended took much time.
