# 100 Days Of Code - Daily Log

## Day 0: October 7th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Started off the course with variables, string manipulation and debugging errors.

### Thoughts: 
This was very easy as i have tried this already, but since I want to commit to this course and code for 100 days to form a habbit, will not skip and commit to this.

## Day 1: October 8th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Data types, Arithmetic operators, Type Error/Checking/Conversion and F string

### Thoughts:
It was easy but interesting with short coding exercises. Have good understanding of type conversion, arithmetic operators and their order now.
f-String is a very handy way to print different data types without the need to convert them first.

## Day 2: October 9th, 2021

### Today's Progress: Conditional statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope

### Thoughts:
Lot of good exercises helped understanding conditional statements and different implementations of them. I struggled with leap year program because of logic interpretation, and this is when i found out that drawing flowchart diagrams in situations like this where you are stuck really really helps a lot.
